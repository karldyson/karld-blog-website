title = "About Me"

Hello and thanks for taking the time to look around.

# Me

First and foremost I'm a father.

After that, in no particular order, I'm a DNS geek; an Enterprise Architect; a Motorsport UK Incident Officer; a Motorsport UK Clerk of the Course; and a photographer.

# Motorsport

I've always been interested in motorsport. I'd seen those folks in orange on the telly and had occasionally wondered how you got involved in that.

Then, in about 1999 a friend and I were chatting at a car club meeting and he said he was going to a marshal training day the following weekend.

It never occurred to me that you could just turn up, volunteer, and *be* a marshal.

So I started going. I enjoyed it. I made a lot of friends.

After a number of years "on the bank", I started to get more involved in the running of the race days, working in Race Control in a variety of roles, and eventually completed the training to become a Clerk of the Course for circuit racing events.

I completed the first phase of that, with my license upgraded to "Deputy" status, and from the start of the 2025 season I've added the Assistant (training/probationary) category for "Speed" events which for me is predominantly allowing me to rediscover my love of hill climbs.

# Career

I'm very lucky to have a job that is mostly like getting paid to do a hobby. Does it have its days? Of course. But I've never woken up disliking the fact that it's a work day. Occasionally (ok, more often than that) I wake up disliking the fact that Oxford's traffic is between me and the office!

I have a background in the design and operations of large scale critical infrastructure and services, mostly involving DNS, DNSSEC, BGP, etc.

I'm not a software developer, but I can get by in perl, python, and a bunch of similar things. I'm currently kinda learning Go.

# What you'll find here

Mostly what you'll find here is stuff I think I should write down. This usually happens when I've either searched for something and couldn't easily find it, or I just fancy writing a post on something I've done or am doing.

If I've found a few minutes to tinker with the camera, there may be pictures to look at too!
