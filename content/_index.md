# Karl's Little World

I've written a few articles through 2025 and have been increasingly dissatisfied with the themes available on Wordpress' platform as a "Personal" subscriber.

I was never quite happy with selecting a theme that gave me both what I wanted for individual articles, nor the occasional gallery for those all too infrequent opportunities to play with the camera.

Whilst reading up on something recently, I came across the [DuckQuill](https://duckquill.daudix.one) theme for [Zola](https://www.getzola.org). This led me to tinkering with the templates.

I don't think I've quite got 100% to grips with it yet, but it seems to be giving me enough flexibility, whilst still making everyday articles pretty straight forward to just write (they're basically Markdown).

Given my Wordpress subscription renews (or (spoiler), not, as it happens) in February and with a little time off over Christmas, I decided to migrate documents from Wordpress, picking the ones that would challenge the ability to tweak the templates to my satisfaction first.

So here we are. I hope you like it, and I hope you find it easy on the eye.

I'll spin up a contacts page soon enough, but in the mean time, <a href="mailto:blog@karld.blog?subject=Blog%20Feedback">email me</a>, or explore the [discussions section of the repository](https://github.com/karldyson/karld-blog-website/discussions).

Thanks,
Karl
